# harbor

harbor is a website designed to allow the user to quickly access a set of websites or a website that they are using frequently. it lets you save a group of websites or just one website to open with a single click.

this sounds pretty dumb but i really needed to open multiple tabs and the first 5 websites on google literally
all did not work which is utterly gobsmacking to me considering the "open all" functionality was the easiest to make LMFAO.
